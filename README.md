# Overview

The program is intended to provide a more interactive and accessible way to find recipes. Moreover, the program has features like creating recipes, finding recipes, and logging in to your account. Not to mention that the program implements a database (Supabase) to save and retrieve information. 

This program represents the opportunity to involve and interact with other people by sharing recipes. The program has a user-friendly interface, so everyone can start adding and finding their new favorite recipe.
